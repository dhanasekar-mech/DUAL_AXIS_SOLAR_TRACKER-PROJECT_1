## Introduction

Solar panels achieve maximum efficiency when they directly face the sun. Traditional fixed solar panels cannot adjust their orientation, resulting in energy losses. This project solves this issue by implementing a dual-axis solar tracker capable of real-time adjustments based on the sun's position. The tracker uses **LDRs** to sense light intensity and servo motors for precise alignment. A rain sensor is incorporated for safety, ensuring the system reacts promptly to weather changes.

## Key Components

- **Arduino Uno**: Serves as the microcontroller to process sensor inputs and control servo motors.
- **4 LDRs**: Measure light intensity to determine the sun's direction.
- **2 MG995 Servo Motors**: Control the solar panel's movement along the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes.
- **Rain Sensor**: Detects rain and signals the panel to return to a safe position.
- **Solar Panel**: Mounted on the tracker for testing and demonstration purposes.
- **Power Supply**: Provides energy for the Arduino and motors.

## Working Principle

1. **Light Detection**: The 4 LDRs are positioned in a cross-pattern to detect the sun's intensity from different directions.
2. **Signal Processing**: The Arduino Uno processes the LDR readings to determine the direction of maximum light intensity.
3. **Motor Control**: Based on the processed signals, the Arduino drives the two MG995 servo motors to align the panel with the sun.
   - One servo controls horizontal (east-west) movement.
   - The other controls vertical (north-south) movement.
4. **Rain Detection**: If rain is detected, the rain sensor overrides the tracking mechanism and moves the panel to a safe horizontal position.
